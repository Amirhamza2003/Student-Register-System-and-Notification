Student-Register-System-and-Notification
This mini-project, Student Register System and Notification, is designed to streamline the process of tracking student attendance and sending real-time notifications to parents via WhatsApp. The system allows teachers to mark attendance and automatically send a message to parents if their child is absent from school.

Attendance Tracking: Teachers can mark students as present or absent.
Automated Notifications: Automatically send a customized message to parents when their child is marked absent.
Session Management: Uses Djangoâ€™s session management to keep track of absent students and ensure the right messages are sent.
